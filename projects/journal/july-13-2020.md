Today I decided it would be best to write how I feel for my own mental health. 
Here is how I feel right now today:

Tara doesn't love me and she will one day leave me. For her ex. Nothing I can do will stop that.

I won't ever be happy.

The only person who will ever love me is a 250 lb runt who didn't value me ot lose weight.

I feel like I am in a place of where the only happiness that matters is hers and I need to adapt to the things that make her happy or lose her.

We can't be two happy people who like different things. I love her. I know she is gonna hurt me again.

Living for others to prove them wrong sucks.

My fighting spirit is gone.

There isn't anything to fight for.

The lifestyle I wanted doesn't exist.

I don't know what to do.

I will never get kink again. I need to stop asking for it or I will push her away faster.

Her needs matter only.
